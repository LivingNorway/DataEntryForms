# Data Entry Forms
While waiting for all of our data to be "born-digital", and the machines to take over the world, we would like to ease the pain of data mapping and data cleaning for you. 

## Rational
This project aims at providing a set of low-tec tools for easing data entry and mapping for field based ecological and biodiversity data. The rational behind is that, currently, the major hurdel for most field ecologists when it comes to archiving and publish their data in a DwC standard is the tedious and costly task of mapping raw data. While DwC and the DwC archive is very well suited for data exchange, the format is rarely usefull for data entry and first-hand working with the data. Easing the pain of data mapping, by just an inch, is perhaps the greatest single step that can be taken with moderate effort in order to increase data mobilization of field ecology based data. 

## Tools
The idea is to provide a set of standarized data-entry forms, in the form of spreadsheets with internal data validation procedures, and a pre-defined mapping to DwC and extentions. Different sampling protocols and survey types will have different requirements
